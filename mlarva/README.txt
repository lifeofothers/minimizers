Program is written in Java 1.8 for reducing storage requirements for biological sequence comparison which consist of one script file:
* Main.java

[original paper](http://yorke.umd.edu/papers/genome_papers/minimizerpaper.pdf).


# Usage

To get the minimizers from a sequence, it is necessary to position yourself in the folder with
Main.java file. From terminal, run the "javac Main.java" and then "java Main" to start the program.
In the same folder must be the file with .fa extension wich name is hard coded in code.
Default file is "ecoli.fa". Output is time and memory usage.
