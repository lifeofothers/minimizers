First you need to compile the source code using command:

gcc Minimizer-Blazekovic.c

After you have done that, you can run the program using command:

./a.out (or some other name you picked when compiling)

If you wish to change parameters of program such as w and k, or input file,
just follow the instructions given in source code.
When running the program, you don't pass any arguments to it.
