First, program is compiled using the command:

gcc Minimizer-Blazekovic.c

After that is done, program is run using command:

./a.out (or some other name that is picked when compiling)

Parameters of the program are defined in source code, arguments are not passed when running the program.
If you wish to change parameters of program such as w and k, or input file,
just follow the instructions given in source code.
Input files must be in the same folder as the program (or the path can be changed in source code).
