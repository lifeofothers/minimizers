Programm is written in Python 2.7.

To start generating minimizers, in command prompt, you have to be positioned in the
folder with minimizer_python_2.py file in it. In the same folder must as well exist 
file with genom sequence that we want minimized. After conditions above are satisfied, 
code can be run by writting: >python minimizer_python_2.py file_name 20 20 60, where 
file_name represents the name of the file that holds qenom sequence that we want 
minimized, first 20 represents number of symbols in each minimizer(also known as k), 
second 20 represents number of k - mers in one window (also known as w), and 60
represents substring size. After the code is executed, file named "minimizers.txt"
is created and it contains all the minimizers generated by algorithm.
